Following data exploration, the project builds a neural network model using a Sequential API, comprising multiple layers, including Flatten and Dense layers with ReLU activation. The model is then compiled with the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer and Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function. Subsequently, the model is trained on the training images and labels using the fit method, for a specified number of epochs. The training process displays metrics such as loss and accuracy. After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test dataset, computing the loss and accuracy metrics.
